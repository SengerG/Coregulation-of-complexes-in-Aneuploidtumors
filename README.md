## Summary 

Aneuploidy, defined as whole chromosomal or chromosome arm-level changes, is a hallmark of human tumors, but its role in cancer still remains to be fully elucidated. We studied transcriptomic and proteomic changes induced by whole chromosome-level amplifications in 9830 TCGA and corresponding 298 CPTAC tumor samples by integrating cancer aneuploidy, transcriptomic and proteomic data. We found that only a relatively small number of genes on the amplified chromosomes changed expression while comparably many changes happened on other chromosomes. Moreover, we found an association between those changes on other chromosomes and co-complex members of proteins from amplified chromosomes. Integrating co-abundance analyses between aneuploid proteins and their co-complex members on other chromosomes with protein features revealed that aggregation-prone aneuploid proteins and those involved in a smaller number of complexes are related with stronger correlations with their partners. These findings highlight the importance of compensation for stoichiometric imbalance in protein complexes and suggest that avoiding proteotoxicity of unpaired complex members might allow cancer cells to deal with the excess amount of expression changes induced by aneuploidy.
